# snaffl-vue-single-page
A deliberately self-contained single HTML file that pulls in Vue,js and some vendor scripts to render a Snaffl site id as a complete website. Yes it's all on one long HTML page with styles and all. So download the page, open it on your desktop and see how much it does and maybe you might want to make it look prettier or start adding your own content to snaffl and change the site id to your own top level snaffl deck... I would gladly accept pull requests to add more stylish examples, just name your html page how you want - but please keep it all on one page, don't go setting up remote css and all that depends-on-you-keeping-it-online there jazz...
